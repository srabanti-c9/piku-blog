Just another college student away from and sick of hostel food. Trying to learn how to cook and experimenting with recipes. My interests lie in quite a few things. Ranging from all geeky physics, math and to the artsy stuff like painting, poetry and well cooking. 
 

Food:

From not being alloweed in the kitchen after burning myself while making tea to now cooking meals for two in just few months. I think I have come quite some way but I still a long way to go.


My paintings:

Self taught artist. I try to dab with acrylics and oil paintings. Pretty much a novice just trying to improve.


Poems:

For me it is just a way to express my feelings when i feel low. You feel find me talking about depression and my fight with it.


Weight loss:

I currently weigh 87kgs. I found myself weighing 90kgs and a horrible health. I have started going to gym from March 2019 and i will try to write about how it goes.
