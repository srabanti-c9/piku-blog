Just another college student away from home and sick of hostel food. Trying to learn how to cook and experimenting with recipes. My interests lie in quite a few things. Ranging from all geeky physics, math and to the artsy stuff like painting, poetry and well cooking. 
 

Food:

From not being allowed in the kitchen after burning myself while making tea to now cooking meals for two in just few months. I think I have come quite some way but I still have a long way to go. I will try to write about my successes and failures of my recipes over here.


My paintings:

Self taught artist. I try to dab with acrylics and oil paintings. Pretty much a novice just trying to improve.


Poems:

For me it is just a way to express my feelings when i feel low. You feel find me talking about depression and my fight with it.


Weight loss:

After realizing how bad my health has gotten cause of my weight I have started going to gym regularly and have been trying to  live a healthier life. I will try to document it as much as I can.
