So, I have been struggling with depression since about 2012 and general anxiety disorder since 2017. Recently I have started going to a psychiatrist who gave me a temporary diagnosis of borderline personality disorder, dysthymia, and general anxiety disorder. Quite a good cocktail, isn't it? After shifting to my current location I had been stable but since last December things had been going worse for me. 

I am on medication and go for regular counseling. If I am regular with my medication, things remain mostly fine. but sometimes I forget to take them and things go worse. And I am just learning to survive this. Things have gotten better but I still have a long way to go. So far I still haven't seen much improvement through counseling in my case (no, I am not discouraging counseling or anything). 

This post will be updated regularly.
