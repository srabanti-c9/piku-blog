So, I have been struggling with depression since about 2012 and general anxiety disoreder since 2017. Recently I have started going to a psychiatrist who gave me a temporary diagonisis of borderline personality disorder, dysthymia and general anxiety disorder. Quite a good cocktail, isn't it? After shifting to my currentlocatioon I had been stable but since last December things had been going worse for me. 

I am on medication and go for regular counselling. If I am regular with my medication, things remain mostly fine. but sometimes I forgrt to take them and things go worse. And I am just learning to survive this. Things have gotten better but I still have a long way to go.
