## Growing up

I have been struggling with body image ever since I remember. Growing up in South Korea I was bullied cause of my looks, I was teased cause of my skin color, made fun of my big nose, I was isolated by my classmates in the Korean playschool.

 Things had improved for me when I changed my school to an international one. But I was always this dark Indian kid. I had no friends growing up I was always this wanted foreigner in the housing complex I lived in. The only time I felt like myself was when I was busy with the computer or in my piano class. I was the youngest student there and all the elder students adored me. I still remember my piano teacher, I don't remember her name but I remember how she looked, how much she loved me and I still have her two teddy bears that she gifted me on my last day of her class before I returned to India.

## Returning to India


After coming back I was isolated again for my poor Hindi and a blend American and Korean accent when it came to speaking in English. I was the weird one here. I started gaining weight for some reason despite all the activities I used to do. My relationship with my parents got worse. My mom started body-shaming me from around when I was 9. Things were going south for me. People made fun of me. My names were written on the walls with charcoal, the kids abused me, calling me fat, mad, an idiot and what not. 

Around that point, my dad's friend got divorced and he started coming around our place more often. That's about the time when my sexual abuse started. At that point, I didn't realize what was going on with me.

Incidents like this continued for a long time. My parents' body-shaming, slut-shaming. Everyone had given up on me. I had given up on me. I hated myself and that's when my depression came in. My parents just passed it om as another phase but it wasn't. 

It took me nine years to understand that I need to love myself.
