## Back story

My boyfriend and I generally tend to go to different restaurants each weekend trying to take full advantage of the Zomato gold membership that we bought few months back. We both enjoy good food and drinks but were never really interested in taking photos of them. Since I started this blog we decided that from now on we will click photos of our food and write review of it and the restaurant.

So Last week after a long discussion we decided to go to Pazzo which has 1+1 on food for zomato gold subscribers. Does it seemlike I am advertizing zomato too much? (oops! again). Anyway let us go back too the topic.

## The restaurant 

It was a short walk away from our place. And we being the weirdos have started playing pokemon go again . Collecting a bit too many aipoms on the way. We arrived at the restaurant without losing our way.

### Ambience 

As far the ambience goes, it was actually quite nice. Well lit and sootihing. It has two types of seating. One which resembles to s those mettalic picnic table, this one was wooden. The other option is tall tables and chairs. 

On the menu it claied to have board games which we could ask for but they said that the menu has just been changed and they have not got the board games yet.

## Food

The restaurant had very good reviews on zomato so I did have a high expectation but seeing the menu I started to regret going there. It was pretty underwhelming for a restaurant claiming to serve pizzas and pastas. I decided to go with pesto alfredo with bacon and Yash(my boyfriednd) got double cheese alfredo with beef.

As far as the taste goes, the food was quite mediocre. Alfreddo was alright the beef was good but lacked seasoning. In case of Pesto the flavor was just not their and when told about it they fixed it up. The pasta was a bit mushy and not al-dente. And apparently that's how Yash likes. He even likes his rice mushy!



## Verdict

Not a bad place but not great either.
