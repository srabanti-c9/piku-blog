  Potatoes sauted in clarified butter(ghee) and seasoned with salt and paper.

  I don't really have a proper name for this recipe. I grew up eating this on those rare sunday breakfast when mom decided to make this. It usually used to occur after a week of begging and whining for this. My sister, who hates potatoes, would fight with me over who got more of it.
