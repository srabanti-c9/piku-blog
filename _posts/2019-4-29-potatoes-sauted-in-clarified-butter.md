I don't really have a proper name for this recipe. I grew up eating this on those rare sunday breakfast when mom decided to make this. It usually used to occur after a week of begging and whining for this. My sister, who hates potatoes, would fight with me over who got more of it. 

My study break is going on right now. Today i woke up early to make this dish. This turned out to be pretty good, lacked a bit of but it took me straight back to home. I hope you guys would like this recipe.

So my recipe serves two people.

Ingredients:

 1. Two medium sized potatoes (pressure cooked or boiled till soft, without skin)
 2. 1 TBSP of clarified butter(ghee)
 3. Black peper ( According to taste )
 4. Salt ( According to taste )

 Procedure:

1. Add the ghee to the pan and let it heat up.
2. Add the potatoes which have been boiled, peeled and cut into small pieces.
3. Saute the potatoes in pan and add black pepper and salt.
4. Cook it till the ghee is absorbed. You can also cook it till there is a nice crust on the potatoes.

Tastes great with toast.
