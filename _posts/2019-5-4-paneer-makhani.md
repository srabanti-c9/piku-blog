## Story

Growing up there was this competition between my parents on who can make a better paneer dish. My mom used to make Paneer makhani and another recipe that doesn't have a name. My dad swore by his shahi paneer. My sister disliked paneer makhani, probably cause of the honey my mom used to add but that has remained one of my favorite dishes till now.

Now that I got a chance to make some paneer I decided to make this recipe. And as always there were some or the other item missing. And guess what? I didn't have BUTTER! I think the name of my blog should be constrained-cooking instead!

So I  made do with sunflower oil. It took me about 1 hour and 30 minutes in total. And this recipe can easily serve four.


## Recipe

1. Paneer (200grams)
2. Onion (1 Large)(chopped)
3. Tomatoes (2 medium)(diced)
4. cashews (7-8 of them)
5. Bay leaf (1)
6. Cumin seeds (1/2 tsp)
7. Green cardamom (4-5)
8. Cinnamon (1 inch)
9. Cloves (3-4)
10. Garlic (crushed 2 tsp)
11. Fresh cream

## Procedure

1. Heat the pan and add about 2 TBSP of oil.

2. When the oil is heated, add the cumin, bay leaf, green cardamom, cinnamon, and cloves.

3. Saute it till an aroma comes out.

4. Add half of the crushed garlic and cook till the pungent smell disappears.

5. Add the chopped onions and cook it till it turns translucent and the raw flavor disappears.

6. Add the cashews and saute it a bit.

7. Add the diced tomatoes and cook it till oil comes out. I tend to add a very small amount of water time-to-time to make sure the tomatoes are not raw.

8. When the content cools down a bit. Add the whole thing to a mixer-grinder and grind it to a fine paste.

9. Heat the pan and add a TBSP of oil.

10. Add the rest of the garlic and a tsp of Kashmiri red chili powder.

19. Saute till the garlic is cooked.

20. Add the paste and let it reduce down a bit.

21. Add salt and stir the paste well.

22. Add paneer (Cut the paneer in cubes and soak it in water for 20 minutes)

23. Add a cup of water and 2 tsp of sugar. You can add more if you want.,

24. Let it simmer for 5 minutes.

25. Add half a cup of fresh cream.

26. Add Kasuri methi and turn off the heat.

The dish is ready!
